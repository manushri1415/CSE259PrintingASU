# CSE259PrintingASU
In this project, we will print a pattern that looks like the following image, which says ASU inside a rectangle. The graders will be doing queries like asu(LeftRightMargin, BottomTopMargin, SpaceBetweenCharacters, FontSize). For example, asu(3, 1, 3, 3). We are going to check with different values of these variables.
