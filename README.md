#PrintingASU
In this project, I will print a pattern that looks like the following image, which says ASU inside a rectangle. We can use queries like asu(LeftRightMargin, BottomTopMargin, SpaceBetweenCharacters, FontSize). For example, asu(3, 1, 3, 3). I am going to check with different values of these variables. I split the tasks equally with members working on each letter (S and U). I also added a check to ensure if the values are negative it outputs "False" (boundry check)
